Version 0.8.1

> Added 'menuPath' property to the Module class.  This allows a module's Start Menu path
  to be declared.  Use of Menu Modules are no longer needed.
  File: system/core/Module.js
  File: system/core/App.js

> Added 'qo_modules_files' and 'qo_modules_stylesheets' tables.

> Module dependencies are now loaded with the module.  A module's dependency should not
  be another module.
  File: system/os/os.php
  
  Todo:
  Track loaded dependencies to ensure they are only loaded once, since a dependency could
  be shared among many modules.

  loaded on demand.

  In the course of adding this functionality most (if not all) files have been updated.
  Database tables have also been updated.
  I do not have time to detail each update individually at this time.
